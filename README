NAME
    Alien::Win32::LZMA - Install and make available lzma.exe

DESCRIPTION
    On Windows (unlike on Unix systems) the primary mechanism for accessing
    LZMA functionality is via the 7-Zip desktop application.

    Alien::Win32::LZMA is a simple Alien module which embeds a copy of the
    lzma.exe command line utility for use in situations where the
    memory-only compression and decompression provided by the current
    generation of modules is not sufficient.

FUNCTIONS
  lzma_exe
    The "lzma_exe" function returns the location of the installed lzma.exe
    command line application as a string.

  lzma_version
    The "lzma_version" function runs lzma.exe and finds the version of the
    application. It should match the version of this module.

  lzma_compress
      lzma_compress('file', 'file.lz') or die('Failed to compress');

    The "lzma_compress" function invokes lzma.exe to compress one file into
    another file.

    Any additional params to "lzma_compress" will be passed through to the
    underlying command line call as options.

    Returns true if the invocation returns without error.

  lzma_decompress
      lzma_decompress('file','file.lz') or die('Failed to decompress');

    The "lzma_decompress" function invokes lzma.exe to decompress an LZMA
    file into another file.

    Any additional params to "lzma_compress" will be passed through to the
    underlying command line call as options.

    Returns true if the invocation returns without error.
